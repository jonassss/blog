The purpose of this blog and site is to document for the technology projects I work on besides school and work, and perhaps some thought experiments I fiddle on in my passing time. Because of this, the frequency of the posts will vary depending on how busy i am.

I don't expect a lot of people to be reading this blog, but I still find it worth while to publicly document for my thoughts and hobby projects. This is because it will help to display what I am capable of, and perhaps help other people create new things or ideas.

And to whomever is reading this, i hope you have a good day :)
